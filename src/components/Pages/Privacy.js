            At our sole discretion, Find Pro Hands may offer any of the
            following free services on the Website, which you may select to use
            or receive at your option. Certain of the following services may
            require you to provide additional personal information as detailed
            below:
            <br />
            1. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS We may offer a free electronic newsletter
            to users. We will gather the email addresses of users who sign up
            for Find Pro Hands for the newsletter mailing list. Users may remove
            themselves from this mailing list by opting out of receiving
            newsletters during the registration process, by following the link
            provided in each newsletter that points users to a subscription
            management page where the user can unsubscribe from receiving
            newsletters or by changing their preferences in their Profile
            Settings page.
            <br />
            2. "SEND TO A FRIEND" Our Website users can voluntarily choose to
            electronically forward a link, page, or document to someone else by
            clicking "send to a friend." To do so, the user must provide his or
            her email address, as well as the email address of the recipient.
            The user's email address is used only in the case of transmission
            errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email.
            The information is not used for any other purpose.
            <br />
            3. POLLING We may offer interactive polls to users so they can
            easily share their opinions with other users and see what our
            audience thinks about important issues, Services, and/or the
            Website. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are
            not identifiable to any particular user. We may use a system to
            "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a
            particular question. This tag is not correlated with information
            about individual users.
            <br />
            4. SURVEYS We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better
            target our content to our Website users. We will not share
            individual responses from these surveys with any third party. We
            will share aggregate data with third party service providers,
            partners, and other third parties. We also will post aggregate data
            containing survey responses on our Website; that data may be viewed
            and downloaded by other users of our Website.

            Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you
            should not expect, that your personal information or private
            communications will not be collected and used by others. You should
            take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password,
            phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using
            a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows
            or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.
            Find Pro Hands is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your
            information or for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for
            any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.

            <br />
            1. INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO PROTECT US AND OTHERS We may disclose

            etc.) or other legal requirement of any governmental authority, (ii)
            disclosure would potentially mitigate our liability in an actual or

            Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use etc. (iv) disclosure is intended to
            help investigate or prevent unauthorized transactions or other

            2. INFORMATION DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND
            BUSINESS PARTNERS We may contract with various third parties for the
            provision and maintenance of the Website, Services and our business

            information and data generated by cookies and aggregate information
            (collectively, "information") with these vendors and service
            agencies. For example, we may provide your information to a credit
            card processing company to process your payment. The vendors and
            service agencies will not receive any right to use your personal
            information beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to
            provide the Services to you. If you complete a survey, we also may
            share your information with the survey provider; if we offer a
            survey in conjunction with another entity, we also will disclose the
            results to that entity.
            <br />
            3. DISCLOSURE TO NON-AFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES IN FURTHERANCE OF YOUR

            site, and will be directed to our Website where they will have
            access to your contact details (Partial or complete), as would any
            other service provider on our Website interested in bidding on your
            request.
            <br />
            4. DISCLOSURE TO OTHER USERS OF OUR WEBSITE If you are a Service
            Professional, the information that you post (other than your payment
            information) is available to other users of our Website and our
            Services. Comments that users post to our Website also will be
            available to other visitors to our Website (see our discussion of
            User Generated Content below). In addition, we will post the results
            (in aggregate form) of surveys to our Website. If you are a
            consumer, name, and location, as well as the details of your
            request, are available to all visitors to our Website. Bidding

            history, quoting and listing history, and fraud complaints, to law

            <br />
            6. IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL OR BANKRUPTCY In the event
            that Find Pro Hands undergoes a change in control, including,
            without limitation, a merger or sale of all or substantially all of
            Find Pro Hands’ assets to which this Website relates or other
            corporate reorganization in which Find Pro Hands participates, and
            is thus merged with or acquired by a third party entity (a
            "Successor"), Find Pro Hands hereby reserves the right to transfer
            the information we have collected from the users of the Website
            and/or Services to such Successor. In addition, in the event of Find
            Pro Hands’ bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership, or assignment
            for the benefit of creditors, or the application or laws or
            equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, Find Pro
            Hands may not be able to control how your information is
            transferred, used, or treated and reserves the right to transfer the
            information we have collected from the users of the Website and/or
            Services to non-affiliated third parties in such event.
            <br />
            7. INFORMATION DISCLOSED AT YOUR REQUEST We may share your personal
            information with other Registered Users to whom you explicitly ask
            us to send your information or if you explicitly consent to such
            disclosure upon receipt of a specific Service. For instance, when
            you contract for a specific Service with another Registered User,
            Find Pro Hands will send that Registered User a notice that includes
            the personal information that you have chosen to allow Find Pro
            Hands to reveal to users with whom you contract.

            information in the following ways: You can review, correct and
            delete your personal information by logging into the Website and
            navigating to your preferences page in "Edit Profile." You must
            promptly update your personal information if it changes or is
            inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your personal
            information because it is very difficult to verify your identity
            remotely. Nonetheless, upon your request we will close your Account
            and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably
            possible based on your Account activity and in accordance with
            applicable law. We do retain information from closed Accounts in

            resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
            investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and
            take any other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem
            necessary in our sole and absolute discretion. You should
            understand, however, that once you publicly post a Request, Offer,
            Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Website, you may
            not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed
            your Account, you agree that Find Pro Hands shall not be responsible
            for any personal information that was not included within your
            deleted and/or removed Account that remains on the Website.

            information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails
            about your Account or any Services you have requested or received

            J. Your Full Name and Use of Find Pro Hands Information
          </h1>
          <p>
            1. YOUR FULL NAME As a Registered User of the Website you will
            select a Full Name during the registration process. All of your
            activities on the Website will be traceable to your Full Name.
            Certain other people, including other Registered Users with whom you
            have transacted business via the Website, can see a large part of
            your activity on the Website. If you book a service with a
            Registered User, cancel a scheduled service with a Registered User,
            receive an offer on your posted service from a Registered User, or
            have posted a service, Find Pro Hands may send a notice to you or
            the appropriate Registered User that includes your Full Name. Thus,
            if you associate your real name with your Full Name, the people to
            whom you have revealed your name may be able to personally identify
            your Website activities.
            <br />
            2. USING INFORMATION FROM FIND PRO HANDS The Website facilitates
            your sharing of personal information with others in order to
            negotiate, provide, and use the Services. If you agree to contract
            for a service with another Registered User, you may need to reveal
            your name, email, phone number, or personal address to that
            individual so that the service may be performed. Please respect the
            privacy of others. You agree to use the information of other users
            solely for the following purposes: (a) Find Pro
            Hands-transaction-related purposes; and (b) using Services offered
            through the Website.
            <br />
            3. ACCOUNT PROTECTION Your password is the key to your Account. When
            creating your password you should use unique numbers, letters,
            special characters, and combinations thereof. In addition, DO NOT
            disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or
            your personal information with others, you are solely responsible
            for all actions taken via your Account. If you lose control of your
            password, you may lose substantial control over your personal
            information and be subject to legally binding actions taken on your
            behalf. Thus, IF YOUR PASSWORD HAS BEEN COMPROMISED FOR ANY REASON,
            YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY FIND PRO HANDS TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD.
